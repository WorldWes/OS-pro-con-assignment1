# OS-pro-con-assignment1

This is a program that solves the producer-consumer problem using mutex and semaphores.
There are 2 producers and 2 consumers in this program.
The max buffer size and the max items a producer can produce or a consumer can consume is 4.
There are two files needed to run this program. (pro_con.h & pro_con.c)
One file contains the producer and consumer functions while the other has the main function.
I wanted to use two completely seperate programs but kept getting running errors such as (permission denied). 

The output from running this current code is:
